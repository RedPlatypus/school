1) has no body, just a semicolon

class Database{
	public abstract function connect($host);
}

2) if a class contains an abstract method, the whole class
   must be abstract

abstract class Database{
	public abstract function connect($host);
}

3) abstract classes cannot have objects made of them

$d = new Database("whatever.com"); // fatal error

4) any child class which spawns objects MUST implement all parental abstract methods

class OracleDatabase extends Database{
	public function connect($h){
	}
}
$o = new OracleDatabase("whatever.com"); // success

5) you would create abstract methods in order to guarantee they exist in the children
